    "prompt": "A modern interior space with a tiled wall composed of small square ceramic tiles, arranged in a grid pattern. The tiles transition smoothly from light teal at the top to deep teal at the bottom, creating a subtle gradient effect. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting the color shift. The scene is viewed straight-on, with no visible text, posters, or technology, and no abstract shapesâ€”only real, tangible materials and surfaces.",
